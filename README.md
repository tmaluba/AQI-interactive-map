# global air quality index made for determining countries with most pollutants
The global air quality index (AQI) is a critical metric for assessing air pollution levels and understanding its impact on public health. A dashboard designed to visualize AQI across major cities can offer valuable insights into trends, regional disparities, and the effectiveness of pollution control policies. By focusing on global data from the past decade, such a dashboard could inform both citizens and decision-makers on air quality challenges and solutions. The dashboard would provide an interactive map that visualizes AQI data across cities worldwide. This map would allow users to filter by country or region, offering a high-level view of global air quality distribution. Cities with worse pollution would be shaded more intensely, making it easy to identify problem areas at a glance.  The making of additional plots would make the distributions of air pollution over the major cities even more readable.
